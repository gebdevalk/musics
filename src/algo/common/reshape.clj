(ns algo.common.reshape
  "Compositional reshaping recipes over already-resolved domain material
   -- typically a real Clojure seq produced by musics.clj/sq, reshaped
   further with ordinary seq functions, then handed to play.

   Distinct from core.domain.flat-domain's per-leaf transforms (transpose/
   invert/times/dotted/dynamic), which reshape one part's own fields in
   place -- transpose/times/dotted/dynamic only ever look at their own
   part. invert is the one exception once an axis isn't given: its own
   no-arg form means each part around its own individual mean (a chord
   folds around its own center, part by part), which is still a per-part
   computation, not a sequence-wide one. This namespace's own invert
   below is the sequence-wide version -- one shared axis, computed from
   every pitch across the whole sequence -- alongside retrograde/
   arpeggiate/hocket's reordering, splitting, and combining."

(defn invert
  "Sequence-level convenience over core.domain.flat-domain/invert: mirrors
   every part in parts around one shared axis pitch, rather than each part
   inverting around its own individual mean. With axis given, this is
   exactly (mapv (d/invert axis) parts). With no axis, the axis used is
   the rounded mean of every pitch across the WHOLE sequence, so the
   sequence folds around its own overall center as one shape -- distinct
   from d/invert's own no-arg form, which means each part around only its
   own pitches."

(defn retrograde
  "Reverse a sequence of parts -- the classical retrograde transform, same
   idea as core.domain.context/env-reverse but applied to a sequence of
   parts rather than a single envelope. Doesn't adjust :tied flags -- a
   tie into what's now the previous note isn't un-tied or re-anchored,
   so a phrase with ties may not retrograde cleanly on its own."
